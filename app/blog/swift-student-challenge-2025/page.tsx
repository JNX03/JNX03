            <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Journey</h2>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Developing Syntaxia was both challenging and rewarding. The idea came from my own experiences learning to
              code and the obstacles I faced. I wanted to create a tool that would make the learning process more
              intuitive and accessible, especially for visual and auditory learners.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              The development process involved extensive research into educational methodologies, cognitive science, and
              user experience design. I spent countless hours refining the interface, optimizing the performance, and
              testing with real users to ensure that Syntaxia was not only functional but also enjoyable to use.
