              Hey there! I'm Jean (JNX03), a developer and tech enthusiast with a passion for making the world a better
              place through technology. I'm excited to start sharing my journey and projects with you through this blog.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Who Am I?</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              I'm a student developer currently based in Thailand, with a deep interest in AI, cybersecurity, and
              accessibility technology. My journey in tech started with a simple curiosity about how things work, and it
              has evolved into a mission to create tools and solutions that can help people.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Introducing Project 1x12</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              I'm thrilled to give you a sneak peek into one of my most ambitious projects yet: Project 1x12. This is a
              quantum computing initiative that aims to break the barriers between classical and quantum computing.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Project 1x12 exists in a state of superposition - between reality and possibility. It's an experimental
              platform that explores the boundaries of quantum mechanics in computing. While I can't reveal all the
              details just yet, I've left some breadcrumbs for the curious minds...
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              If you're interested in discovering more about Project 1x12, try exploring the terminal on this website
              (hint: press ‚åòK or Ctrl+K and look for the terminal option). There might be some quantum-encrypted secrets
              waiting to be discovered...
            </p>
